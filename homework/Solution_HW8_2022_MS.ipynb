    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is leverage risk currently a concern for LTCM?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Many strategies of LTCM rely on converging spreads. LTCM feels that these are almost win/win situations because of the fact that if the spread converges, they make money. If it diverges, the trade becomes even more attractive, as convergence is still expected at a future date.\n",

    "## 1 Conceptual issues for LTCM\n",
    "\n",
    "*Discuss these questions briefly, based on the info in the case. No need to quantitatively answer these questions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe LTCM‚Äôs investment strategy with regard to the following aspects:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Securities traded\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Trading frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Skewness (Do they seek many small wins or a few big hits?)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Forecasting (What is behind their selection of trades?)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**[Solution]**: \n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">LTCM traded across a wide range of securities. They are heavily involved in fixed income and credit, and they also have sizeable positions in equities. In all these asset classes, they trade a large number of securities, across global markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">LTCM's trading frequencies vary given that they house a wide range of strategies. Their largest bucket, the convergence trades, typically take weeks and months to converge. Overall, they are something of a medium-term frequency. Largely, they are not trying to arbitrage intraday movements, nor are they making long-term directional bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">LTCM largely is trying to pick up small premia in the convergence trades, which limits the upside of any individual trade, and leaves it substantial downside, given all the leverage. Of course, aggregating all their trades together can lead to positive skewness if they are properly diversified. But we would expect that their typical trade has a small positive mean with substantial negative skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">For most their trades, LTCM is not making directional forecasts. Rather, they are trading spreads and pairs, forecasting relative convergence rather than absolute levels. In this sense, they do not rely on sophisticated forecasting models of the overall market but rather rely on models to forecast the size and speed of relative convergence in particular markets.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are LTCM‚Äôs biggest advantages over its competitors?\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**[Solution]**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">Several advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">Efficient financing. LTCM got very favorable terms on all financing‚Äîsometimes even zero haircut! Typically had small, if any, outlay.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">Fund size. Have market power even in the large market of institutional wholesale.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">Liquidity. LTCM has in place many mechanisms to ensure liquidity.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">Long-term horizon. In financing and assessing trades, LTCM takes a relatively long-term view. Hedged. LTCM avoids taking too much default risk or explicit directional bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">Then again, LTCM went bust in Aug. 1998, so maybe these advantages were not as strong as it seemed!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The case discusses four types of funding risk facing LTCM:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ collateral haircuts\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ repo maturity\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ equity redemption\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ loan access\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The case discusses specific ways in which LTCM manages each of these risks. Briefly discuss them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**[Solution]**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\"> The case discusses steps LTCM took to manage four types of funding risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\"> Collateral haircuts. For most trades, LTCM obtains 100% financing on a fully collateralized basis. Furthermore, LTCM stress tests the haircuts across its asset classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">Repo. LTCM goes against the norm by entering into relatively long-maturity repo. While much of it is overnight, LTCM uses contracts that typically have maturity of 6-12 months. Furthermore, LTCM manages their aggregate repo maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">Equity redemption. The firm is highly levered, so equity funding risk is especially important. LTCM restricts redemptions of equity year by year. The restriction is particularly strong in that unredeemed money is re-locked.\n",
    "They also spread the redemption windows across the year to ensure there is never a possi- bility of immediate withdrawal of a large portion of equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">For debt funding, LTCM negotiated a revolving loan that has no Material Adverse Change clause. Thus, the availability of debt funding is not so highly correlated with fund performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. LTCM is largely in the business of selling liquidity and volatility. Describe how LTCM accounts for liquidity risk in their quantitative measurements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**[Solution]**: LTCM attempts to account for liquidity risk quantitatively by adjusting security correlations. For short-term horizons, LTCM assumes positive correlation between all trade cat- egories. Even if their net exposure to a strategy flips sides, they still assume positive correlation to the new net position. Given the efforts of LTCM to hedge out obvious market risks, there are many strategies which would seem to have zero correlation. However, LTCM feels that liquidity concerns can cause the effective trading to be positively correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is leverage risk currently a concern for LTCM?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**[Solution]**: It would seem that leverage is not particularly dangerous at the moment. The fund‚Äôs volatility is relatively low, its VaR is relatively low, nor is it particularly high relative to the rest of the industry. Moreover, the firm actively manages its funding risk which theoretically means it should be able to handle the natural risks of high leverage. At the time of the case, the firm is trying to determine whether to further increase leverage. Subsequently, at the end of 1997 the fund returned about a third of its 7.5 billion equity capital to investors. Of course, less than a year later, the fund blew up, but from the time of the case it‚Äôs hard to see the leverage risk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Many strategies of LTCM rely on converging spreads. LTCM feels that these are almost win/win situations because of the fact that if the spread converges, they make money. If it diverges, the trade becomes even more attractive, as convergence is still expected at a future date.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    What is the risk in these convergence trades?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**[Solution]**: What is the risk in these convergence trades? Solution: About a year after the time of the case, the fund loses most of its value due to non-converging trades. So clearly there is some risk! Positions are subject to liquidity risk. If market liquidity dries up or the markets become segmented, the divergent spreads can persist for a long time. This indeed happens later to LTCM. The trades that get them in trouble ultimately pay off, but not before LTCM blows up. LTCM believes it can exit these convergence trades if they become too unprofitable. However, a stop-loss order is not the same as a put option. If the price jumps discontinuously through the stop-loss, then it is ineffective. Or a market may be paralyzed/illiquid when trying to execute the stop-loss. A put option does not need to worry about price impact, whereas a stop-loss does. Finally, a stop-loss ensures that an investor sells as soon as a security price hits a worst-case scenario, ensuring unfavorable market timing.\n",
